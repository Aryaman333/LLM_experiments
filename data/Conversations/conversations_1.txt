Teacher:	{'summary': "Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other elements of the Earth's climate system. It is primarily driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Global warming, a significant aspect of climate change, specifically refers to the rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to these greenhouse gases. The effects of climate change are widespread, impacting ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels, and pose significant challenges to communities worldwide. It is essential for us to understand our role in mitigating these effects and to take steps towards sustainable practices to protect our planet for future generations.", 'questions': {'Q1': 'Imagine you are a leader in your community.
