Teacher:	{'summary': "Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have accelerated the process, leading to global warming. This increase in Earth's average temperature can have severe consequences, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. It is crucial to understand how our actions impact the planet and explore sustainable solutions to mitigate these effects, such as renewable energy, conservation efforts, and community initiatives. Addressing climate change requires collective action from individuals, communities, and governments worldwide.", 'questions': {'Q1': 'Imagine a small coastal village is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels.
